<h2>Step 1 – Draw the Tic Tac toe board</h2>
Tic Tac Toe Board example 
To play Tic Tac Toe, you must draw the Tic Tac Toe board on paper. The board includes a grid of three columns and three rows, and these rows and columns make a grid with nine boxes. However, if you play the game on a digital device, the 3×3 board is already made for you.</p>

<p><h2>Step 2 – Decide who goes first</h2>
You have to decide which player gets to play the ‘X’ and ‘O’ alphabet before starting the game. Each player can only use one of these alphabets throughout a game. Usually, the player that gets to play ‘X’ as their alphabet starts the game with their turn being the first. Whereas the player that gets to play ‘O’ plays the second turn.</p>

<p><h2>Step 3 – Start the game</h2>
In the first turn, the player will have to place the ‘X’ alphabet in one of the nine boxes.  After the player one plays their turn, the second player, having ‘O’ as their alphabet, will play. The second player can place ‘O’ in any remaining eight boxes. Players have to continue taking turns alternately until one of the players emerges as the winner.</p>

<p><h2>Step 4 – Win the game</h2>
The game’s primary goal is to place three alphabets in either vertical, horizontal, or diagonal directions, and the first player to achieve it wins the game. Players should keep this in mind while playing their turns. These are all the Tic Tac Toe rules players need to know.</p>
<p>
However, if no player wins the game and all the boxes are filled, the game is considered a draw. Both the players have to play a rematch in such a situation until a single winner is declared.

In contrast to popular beliefs, Tic Tac Toe is not a game of chance. It is a skill-based game. Skills and strategies can be learned over time to excel at the game. However, if you want to become a pro-Tic Tac Toe player, you have to put a lot of effort and time into optimizing your skills to the best extent.</p>
