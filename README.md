# Automatic Skin Cancer Type Detection System Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Introduction

Skin cancer is a significant health concern globally, with early detection playing a crucial role in treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. This project aims to develop an automatic skin cancer type detection system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify skin lesions. The system is designed to streamline the diagnostic process for dermatologists and improve the efficiency of skin cancer detection.

## Scope of the Work

The scope of this project encompasses the development and implementation of a CNN-based system for the automatic detection and classification of various types of skin cancer lesions. Key aspects include image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction using CNNs, classification of skin lesions, evaluation and validation of the system's performance, and the creation of a user-friendly interface for clinicians.

## Survey of the Previous Works

Previous research in the field of skin cancer detection has primarily focused on manual inspection by dermatologists or the development of computer-aided diagnostic systems. While traditional methods have shown effectiveness, they are often time-consuming and subject to human error. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly CNNs, have revolutionized the field by enabling automated analysis of dermatoscopic images with high accuracy.
